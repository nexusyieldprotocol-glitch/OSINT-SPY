**Title:** Adaptive Quantum-Resilient Zero Trust Framework Enabled by Agentic AI

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity for AMCIS 6.0 (The Next Transformation), a highly innovative feature integrates Agentic AI with post-quantum cryptography to realize an Adaptive Quantum-Resilient Zero Trust Framework (AQZT Framework). This architecture leverages Agentic AI’s autonomous decision-making capabilities to dynamically enforce Zero Trust principles across hybrid and cloud-native environments, anticipating and countering threats amplified by emerging quantum computing capabilities. The framework automatically adapts authentication, authorization, and continuous monitoring policies based on real-time risk assessments derived from multi-source telemetry, behavioral analytics, and quantum threat vectors. Core to this innovation is the seamless incorporation of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, such as lattice-based and hash-based signatures, which future-proof cryptographic agility against quantum attacks without sacrificing performance.

Technically, the AQZT Framework deploys decentralized Agentic AI nodes embedded within the network fabric and endpoints, which continuously learn and optimize security controls autonomously. These nodes utilize reinforcement learning to predict potential breach attempts, dynamically adjusting access privileges and cryptographic protocols in near real-time. Integration with post-quantum key exchange schemes ensures all session keys and digital signatures remain secure against adversaries wielding quantum computers. The framework’s modular design facilitates interoperability with existing identity providers and security information and event management (SIEM) systems, enabling organizations to evolve toward a quantum-secure Zero Trust posture with minimal operational disruption. By merging Agentic AI with Zero Trust and post-quantum cryptography, AMCIS 6.0 positions itself at the forefront of resilient cybersecurity innovation for the quantum era.
